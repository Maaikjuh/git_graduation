biventricular_meshing:
Contains demonstration scripts for creating and using a biventricular mesh.


double_circulation:
Contains demonstration scripts for setting up simulations of the double circulation (biventricular simulations).


inflation:
Contains a demonstration script for performing a simple passive inflation of the left ventricle.


lifetec:
Contains demonstration scripts for setting up simulations that model the LifeTec experiments (LV only simulations with open loop circulation).


posprocessing:
Contains postprocessing scripts for FEM-related postprocessing (e.g. displacement, strain, stress, fiber (re)orientation).


quadrature_elements:
Contains a demonstration script for using quadrature elements (which can be used to define the fiber basis on).


systemic_circulation:
Contains demonstration scripts for setting up simulations of the systemic circulation (LV only simulations with closed loop circulation).
